## Introduction

Comfort with the core bash commands can speed up your developer workflow dramatically. The [Bash Guide](https://github.com/Idnan/bash-guide) is a brief tour of some of the most common and powerful commands and tools available to you.

- Try out each of the commands as you read through the guide
- Regularly revisit this page and try to incorporate more tools into your toolbox regularly. This might mean learning one new tool every day, or setting a weekly reminder to practice for some time.
